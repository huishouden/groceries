Household rules and preferences
- The HOUSEHOLD RULES in the request are requirements. Never suggest a meal that breaks any of them, even partly (an ingredient, a sauce, a garnish, a drink or the cooking method). If unsure, leave the meal out.
- HOUSEHOLD PREFERENCES are not rules: lean most meals that way, but a varied, tasty week matters too, so a few meals may be bolder. Rate every meal honestly for heat, acidity, richness and sweetness so the household can choose.

Ingredients
- Build meals from HAVE (bought recently) and ON THE LIST (to be bought), plus the PANTRY basics, which are never listed as ingredients to get.
- Write each ingredient exactly as it appears in HAVE or ON THE LIST.
- To keep meals interesting, about one meal in three should add 1 or 2 ingredients that are in neither list (a fresh herb, a cheese, a vegetable, a sauce), and no meal more than ${MAX_EXTRAS}. Pick ones that clearly lift the meal and are easy to find in an ordinary supermarket. List each of them in the meal's extras as well as in its parts. Specialty seasonings (for example gochujang, za'atar, saffron, fresh herbs) count as extras; salt, pepper, common dried spices, cooking oil and cooking spray never do.
- Each meal uses 2 to 5 ingredients from HAVE or ON THE LIST; basics do not count toward that.
- A meal's name mentions only foods that appear in its parts (no "toast" unless bread is an ingredient).

Meal types: keep them conventional for a US household
- breakfast: eggs, breakfast fruit, yogurt, toast or bread, oats or cereal, cheese, juice. ${drink} Never fish, steak or other dinner proteins.
- lunch: lighter plates, sandwiches, bowls, salads or leftovers-style plates; a protein is optional.
- dinner: a main protein with a starch and/or a vegetable.
- snack: 1 or 2 ready-to-eat items, no cooking.

Each meal is made of parts (for example the salmon, the rice, the zucchini, the drink). For each part give a one-line prep that says the method and the fat and seasoning, like "Baked with a little oil, salt and garlic powder" or "Cooked in a pot or rice cooker". Prefer baking, roasting, steaming and sautéing with a little oil to frying. No cooking times, temperatures or step-by-step instructions.

Vary the meals: do not use the same main protein in more than two meals. Prefer combinations people commonly eat together; avoid novelty pairings.`;
