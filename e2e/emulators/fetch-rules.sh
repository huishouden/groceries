# The browser tests run against the household's real Firestore rules, which live in huishouden/rules.
# Fetched fresh for each run (not committed) from main, because main is what is deployed: testing
# against it catches the app and the live rules disagreeing, at the cost of a re-run of an old commit
# possibly seeing newer rules. RULES_REF pins another branch or commit, e.g. RULES_REF=my-branch to
# try a rules PR with this app, or RULES_REF=<sha> to reproduce an old run exactly.
